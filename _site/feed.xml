&lt;p&gt;블로그를 쓰기 시작해야 겠다는 생각을 최근에 하게 된 이유 중 가장 큰 이슈는 책 “생각이 너무 많은 서른 살에게”를 보고 난 뒤이다. 책을 보고 글쓰기에 대한 생각을 하게 되어 글쓰기를 통해서 자신을 찾는 것이 얼마나 중요한 일이고 글쓰기가 자신을 돌아볼 수 있는 장소라는 것에서 매료되었다. 분명히 나는 글쓰기를 그렇게 잘하는 타입도 아니고 글쓰기를 좋아하는 타입도 아니다. (실제로 회사에서 간단한 보고서를 쓸 때마나 너무나 스트레스 받는게 주위 사람들에게도 보일 정도이니 말 다했다.) 하지만, 글쓰기를 통해서 자신을 돌아볼 수 있다는 사실이 나에게 글을 쓰게 하는 것 같다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;최근에 이것저것 많은 책들을 읽으면서, 블로그에 대한 이야기가 뭔가 돈을 벌기 위해서 하는 수단 같이 느껴지는 부분도 생기고, 실제로 블로그를 통해서 돈을 버는 사례들을 너무나 많이 보게 되어서 목적성이 흔들리는 것 같다. 실제로 나중에 그런 글을 쓸 때가 올 지도 모르겠다. 내 글을 통해서 많은 사람들이 가치를 찾게 되고 내 글을 기꺼이 돈을 주고 사는 그런 날들을 꿈꾸지 않는 것은 아니다. 하지만, 지금은 글쓰는 습관을 들이는 것이 중요한 것이고, 글쓰는 습관을 통해서 나를 찾고 내가 가야 할 길을 확인하는 것이 더 중요하다고 생각한다. 그래서 일단은 돈을 버는 것은 뒤로 접어 두고 블로그를 시작하려고 한다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;진짜로 나에 대한 글을 쓰기 위해서 블로그를 하려고 한다. 물론 이 경우에는 일기를 써도 괜찮을 것 같다. “굳이 개인적인 이야기를 왜 아무도 관심없는 사람들에게 보여주고 내 민낯을 깔 이유가 있을까?” 라는 생각도 든다. 어쩌면 블로그는 내 자신에게 대한 약속이기도 한 것 같다. 한 사람이라도 나의 글을 읽어주는 사람이 있으면 어찌되었건 그들을 위해서 내가 글을 써야 하고 블로그를 하게 되면 좋던 싫던 계속 글을 써야 하는 이유가 될 것 같다. 나는 게으른 사람이라서 누군가 나를 푸쉬해주지 않으면 무언가를 계속하는게 어려운 사람이다. 그래서 그런지 이런게 필요한 것 같다. 내가 계속 글을 쓰게 하는 이유. 독자라는게 없으면 지속적으로 일기를 쓰기 어려울 것 같다.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>OldTechNerd</name></author><summary type="html">블로그에 관해서</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest</title><link href="http://0.0.0.0:4000/2020/01/31/man-must-explore.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest" /><published>2020-01-31T08:45:13-06:00</published><updated>2020-01-31T08:45:13-06:00</updated><id>http://0.0.0.0:4000/2020/01/31/man-must-explore</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://0.0.0.0:4000/2020/01/31/man-must-explore.html">&lt;p&gt;Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;
