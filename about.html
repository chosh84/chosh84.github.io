<p>I'm a programmer, data analyst, project manager who works on asset management insdustry. As people in the industry know, being an IT specialist doesn't give you much credit for what you do, but still I enjoyed my various aspects of my job.  </p>

<p> As a programmer, I was responsible for maintaining performance analysis system and risk managment system. So, I talked a lot with so called front, middle, back office people. Addition to that, I used to work as fund administrator, or fund accoutants, so I know a good deal about asset valuation and its analysis. </p>

<p> As a data analyst, I did a lot of ad-hoc data analysis works for front office. Every year I assist our middle office on yearly performance analysis on the fund. I analyzed FX rating effects on bond portfolios. I analyzed custom industry sector perfomance. And etc.  </p>

<p> As a project manager, I was responsible for FX management system project and global investment solution project </p>

<p> I'm currenly working in a national pension fund </p>
